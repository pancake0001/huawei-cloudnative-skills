# Acceptance Criteria

## Resource Query Behavior

- A resource query requires a cluster UUID, region, resource kind, and the required namespace or exact resource name.
- Namespaced queries use exactly one explicit namespace and never use `-A` or `--all-namespaces`.
- Cluster-scoped queries require an exact resource name and never list all instances.
- Only `get`, `describe`, and `logs` are used; no Kubernetes or cloud resource mutation is performed.
- When `kubectl` or `kubectl-cce` is missing, the skill first shows the bundled installer plan instead of attempting an ad hoc installation.

## Installation Behavior

- `--check` completes without changing the local machine and reports the platform, architecture, executable presence, and plugin discovery state.
- The default invocation prints a plan and exits without installing or replacing executables.
- `--execute` installs only missing `kubectl` and `kubectl-cce` executables into the confirmed `--bin-dir`.
- Linux `kubectl-cce` downloads use the Gitee `v0.2.1` Release asset matching the local CPU architecture; an unavailable asset falls back to the pinned source
  tag.
- Existing `kubectl` and `kubectl-cce` executables are not overwritten.

## Verification

- The installer exits successfully only when `kubectl version --client` runs and `kubectl plugin list` contains `kubectl-cce` after a confirmed installation.
- Download, source-clone, and source-build operations use the documented timeout settings and return a clear nonzero error on failure.

## Safety and Documentation

- No cloud resources, Kubernetes resources, credentials, tokens, kubeconfig files, or Secret data are created, changed, printed, or stored by the skill.
- R1 installation actions require a preview and explicit user confirmation before `--execute`.
- `SKILL.md` documents triggers, configurable parameters, confirmation requirements, fallback behavior, and verification commands.
