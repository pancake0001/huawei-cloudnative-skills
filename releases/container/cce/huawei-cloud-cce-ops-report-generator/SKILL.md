## Overview

This skill generates consolidated operations reports for Huawei Cloud CCE clusters. It aggregates outputs from daily inspection, capacity trend forecasting, availability risk scanning, cost optimization analysis, and optional on-call context into structured reports (weekly, monthly, SLA, capacity, stability). Default behavior is read-only analysis and report generation.

**Architecture**: Python dispatcher (`scripts/huawei-cloud.py`) → `huawei_generate_ops_report` → aggregates from `huawei-cloud-cce-daily-cluster-inspector`, `huawei-cloud-cce-capacity-trend-forecaster`, `huawei-cloud-cce-availability-risk-scanner`, `huawei-cloud-cce-cost-optimization-advisor`, on-call context → Markdown + HTML + JSON reports

### Related Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `huawei-cloud-cce-daily-cluster-inspector` | Daily health inspection and risk summarization |
| `huawei-cloud-cce-capacity-trend-forecaster` | Capacity trend analysis, bottleneck forecasting, HPA simulation |
| `huawei-cloud-cce-availability-risk-scanner` | Availability risk scanning (single replicas, PDB, AZ distribution) |
| `huawei-cloud-cce-cost-optimization-advisor` | Cost optimization analysis (idle resources, oversized requests) |
| `huawei-cloud-cce-auto-remediation-runner` | Execute remediation actions when user authorizes |

### Capabilities

1. One-shot consolidated ops report generation (`huawei_generate_ops_report`)
2. Five report types: `weekly`, `monthly`, `sla`, `capacity`, `stability`
3. Aggregated summaries from inspection, capacity, availability, cost, and on-call sources
4. Prioritized cross-source recommendations with risk levels
5. Markdown and HTML output with trend charts when capacity data is available
6. Optional raw payload traceability (`include_raw=true`)
7. Graceful degradation: reports continue even if individual sources fail, marking data gaps clearly

### Typical Use Cases

- "Generate a weekly ops report for my CCE cluster"
- "Create a monthly operations summary with capacity and availability findings"
- "Produce an SLA report combining inspection and on-call data"
- "Consolidate capacity trends and cost optimization into a stability report"
- "Generate a report with on-call context from last week's incidents"
- "Export a consolidated ops report in HTML with charts"

## Prerequisites

### Python Dependencies

The dispatcher script requires Python >= 3.6 and the following packages:

- `huaweicloudsdkcore`
- `huaweicloudsdkcce`
- `huaweicloudsdkaom`
- `huaweicloudsdkhss`
- `huaweicloudsdkvpc`
- `huaweicloudsdkecs`
- `huaweicloudsdkces`
- `huaweicloudsdkevs`
- `huaweicloudsdkeip`
- `huaweicloudsdkelb`
- `huaweicloudsdkiam`
- `kubernetes`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

Install: `pip3 install huaweicloudsdkcore huaweicloudsdkcce huaweicloudsdkaom huaweicloudsdkhss huaweicloudsdkvpc huaweicloudsdkecs huaweicloudsdkces huaweicloudsdkevs huaweicloudsdkeip huaweicloudsdkelb huaweicloudsdkiam kubernetes matplotlib numpy`

### Credential Configuration

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `HUAWEI_AK` | Yes | Huawei Cloud Access Key |
| `HUAWEI_SK` | Yes | Huawei Cloud Secret Key |
| `HUAWEI_REGION` | No | Default region (overrides `region` param if set) |
| `HUAWEI_PROJECT_ID` | No | Project ID (auto-obtained via IAM API when not set) |
| `HUAWEI_SECURITY_TOKEN` | No | Required when using temporary AK/SK |

🚫 **Never expose or log AK/SK values.** Credentials exist only in the current request call stack and are released after each invocation. Do not write credentials to files, logs, or responses.

✅ **Use environment variables** `HUAWEI_AK` / `HUAWEI_SK` for authentication. The dispatcher reads them automatically.

### IAM Permission Requirements

This skill aggregates data from multiple sub-skills. It requires all permissions needed by:

| Sub-Skill | Required Permissions |
|-----------|---------------------|
| `huawei-cloud-cce-daily-cluster-inspector` | CCE cluster/node/workload/event read, AOM alarm read |
| `huawei-cloud-cce-capacity-trend-forecaster` | CCE cluster/node/nodepool/Deployment/HPA read, AOM metrics read |
| `huawei-cloud-cce-availability-risk-scanner` | CCE cluster/node/workload/PDB/Service/Ingress read, AOM metrics read |
| `huawei-cloud-cce-cost-optimization-advisor` | CCE cluster/node/nodepool/Deployment/HPA/Pod read, AOM metrics read |

---

## Core Commands

All actions are invoked via the dispatcher script:

```bash
python3 scripts/huawei-cloud.py <action> region=<region> cluster_id=<cluster_id> [key=value ...]
```

### 1. Primary Action: Generate Ops Report

The primary action aggregates all sub-skill outputs into a consolidated report:

```bash
python3 scripts/huawei-cloud.py huawei_generate_ops_report \
  region=cn-north-4 cluster_id=<cluster_id> \
  report_type=weekly \
  output_dir=./output
```

Returns: consolidated summary, cross-source recommendations, data gaps, and output files (Markdown, HTML, JSON, optional SVG charts).

### 2. Supporting Context Actions

For follow-up deep dives after report generation:

| Action | Source Skill | Description |

---

## Workflow

1. Collect `region`, `cluster_id`, report type, time window, namespace scope, and output directory from user
2. Execute `huawei_generate_ops_report` — it aggregates from all five sources internally
3. Review generated Markdown report first, then HTML report for charts and visualization
4. For high-risk findings, trace back to source sections:
   - Daily anomalies → `huawei-cloud-cce-daily-cluster-inspector`
   - Risk level and issue categories → `huawei-cloud-cce-availability-risk-scanner`
   - Oversized requests / low utilization → `huawei-cloud-cce-cost-optimization-advisor`
   - Trend slope / bottleneck projection → `huawei-cloud-cce-capacity-trend-forecaster`
5. If customer asks for remediation, switch to explicit change workflow and require authorization — hand off to `huawei-cloud-cce-auto-remediation-runner`

### Data Gap Handling

- If a source report fails, the aggregate report continues and marks that source as degraded
- If on-call input is missing, mark as a context gap instead of failing the report
- Preserve source file pointers and optional raw payloads (`include_raw=true`) for auditability

---

## Verification

1. Run a weekly report with a known cluster:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/huawei-cloud.py huawei_generate_ops_report \
     region=cn-north-4 cluster_id=<cluster-id> \
     report_type=weekly output_dir=./output
   ```
2. Verify `success=true` and all four source summaries are present
3. Check that `recommendations` lists cross-source items with `[source][risk_level]` prefixes
4. Verify `data_gaps` is empty when all sources succeed
5. Confirm `ops-weekly-report.md` and `ops-weekly-report.html` are generated in output_dir
6. Test with `include_raw=true` and verify `ops-weekly-raw.json` contains source payloads
7. Test with `oncall_summary="Test incident"` and verify on-call context appears in summary

---

## Best Practices

1. Always use `huawei_generate_ops_report` as the primary action; it aggregates all sources in one call
2. Choose report type matching the reporting cycle: `weekly` for weekly reviews, `monthly` for monthly summaries, `sla` for SLA tracking, `capacity` for capacity planning, `stability` for stability assessment
3. Use `output_dir` to persist reports for audit and stakeholder review
4. For traceability, use `include_raw=true` to preserve source payloads
5. If on-call context is available, pass it via `oncall_report_path` or `oncall_summary` to enrich the report
6. For high-risk findings, trace back to the relevant sub-skill for detailed remediation plans
7. Do NOT execute write actions (HPA apply, scale, node pool resize, workload mutation) unless the user explicitly authorizes remediation — hand off to `huawei-cloud-cce-auto-remediation-runner`

## Notes

- **Read-only by design** — this skill does NOT modify workloads, HPA, node pools, or cluster configuration
- **Remediation hand-off** — all mutation suggestions are handed off to `huawei-cloud-cce-auto-remediation-runner` with user authorization
- **Never expose or log AK/SK or environment variable values**
- **All actions are executed via `python3 scripts/huawei-cloud.py <action>`; do not use hcloud CLI or direct API calls**
- **Data gaps** — the report continues generation even when individual sources fail; gaps are clearly marked
- **On-call optional** — when on-call context is unavailable, the report still generates with a marked context gap

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Correct Approach |
|---------|-----------------|
| Assuming report fails when one source fails | The report continues with degraded sources; data gaps are explicitly listed |
| Skipping on-call context entirely when unavailable | Mark as a context gap; the report still provides value from other sources |
| Executing remediation directly from report findings | All remediation requires explicit user authorization; hand off to `huawei-cloud-cce-auto-remediation-runner` |
| Not using `output_dir` for persistent reports | Always specify `output_dir` for audit traceability and stakeholder access |
| Treating recommendations as action items without risk context | Each recommendation includes `[source][risk_level]` prefix; prioritize by risk level |
| Ignoring `include_raw` for compliance requirements | Use `include_raw=true` when audit traceability of source data is required |
| Using wrong `report_type` for the reporting cycle | Match report type to cycle: weekly=168h, monthly=744h, sla/capacity/stability=168h by default |
